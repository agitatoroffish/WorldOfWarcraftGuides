My quick run-down on the add-ons you need to be an effective player in ICC...

This is meant for new players and to fill in some of the knowledge gaps that I ran into when I came back to the game last fall after not play for several years.  

# Intro #
Many of the mechanics of the boss fights in ICC focus on spacing and positioning.  So, when you move, and where you move to, are very important.

# Add-Ons # 
You need these add-ons to start:
- [WeakAuras](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/weakauras-2)
- [Deadly Boss Mods](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/deadly-boss-mods)

## WeakAuras ##
The WeakAuras add-on doesn't do much by itself, but it allows you to "import" auras that can do a LOT.  More on that later

## Deadly Boss Mods ##
There's a LOT going on with these encounters.  Personally, I find it very slow and difficult to watch my characters buffs and debuffs for a particular thing and how many "stacks" have gathered, but you have to be aware of these things to be an effective team member.  The Deadly Boss Mods add-on creates a bunch of on-screen timer, audible warnings, and generally coaches you through the boss mechanics.  It does a good job of getting your attention onto what you need to be giving attention to.   

This add-on is going to tell you when you get a debuff that will kill everyone around you if you don't move away from them and other things you need to be aware of to stay alive, not kill your friends, and when to blow your cool-downs.  

I find one of the more useful elements of this add-on is the range indicator (screenshot).  Entering '/range' on your chat window will show the range indicator.  You can tinker with the settings by right clicking on it.  It will show you when you're too close to someone.  

It's not visible by default, but it will appear in the middle of a fight where spacing matters if it's installed.  The default location for this widget was in a bad spot for me. So, I suggest showing the widget before you get into combat with the '/range' command and moving it someplace that won't be in the way.
